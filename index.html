                    <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
                    <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a> , and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>

                    <p>you would also need a text editor and terminal or powershell to write and run your python programs, alternatively you could use repel.it to skip the installation and learn python on your web browser</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vs code</li>

                    <p>Now that you have a text editor and python ready, it's time to write your first program - the Famous hello world program which is what all programers write first - it's kinda a tradition</p>
                    <p> open your text editor and make a new file, type <code>print("hello world")</code> and save the file with a <code>.py</code> file extension </p>
                    <p>open a terminal window in the same folder and type <code>python {filename}</code> change filename to the name you save the file with</p>
                    <p>you would see the words hello world print out, congratulations you just wrote your first python program</p>

                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

                        The while statement is used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true:
                    </p>
                    <code> i = 1 
 while i < 6: 
    i += 1 </code>
                    <p>The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.  </p>
