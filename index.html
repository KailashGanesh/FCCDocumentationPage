                    <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
                    <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a> , and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
